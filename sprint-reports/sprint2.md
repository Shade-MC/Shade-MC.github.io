# Sprint 2 Report (9/10/21 - 10/7/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created requirements and solutions approach sections of project report
 * Created UI mock ups, presented to client, and received feedback and ideas for new features
 * Created initial react app, which will be used as the basis for our remaining UI features
 * Implemented React component for Login feature (however, not yet integrated with backend)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In addition to making progress on our project report, we finally began the development phase of our project. Namely, we installed all the dependencies required for the MERN stack, which include NodeJS, React, MongoDB, and Express, and initialized our React app. We then chose to implement the Login component for our sprint's basic UI feature. 

## Unfinished Work
Although we completed the user-facing portion of the Login feature, we still need to integrate it with our Express/MongoDB backend. That is, we still need to create the API for processing login requests and create the necessary infrastructure in our MongoDB database to store and query user account information. 

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication between team members
  * Quickly completing assigned tasks
  * Splitting work between team members
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Improved communication with our client
   * Being more proactive in taking/assigning issues
   * Beginning tasks well before due date to make room for potential roadblocks (i.e., padding)
   * Updating our Github tasks/issues more frequently to ensure they're up to date (as opposed to only giving task updates in group chat)
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Fully implement login (i.e., with backend integration, not just frontend UI)
   * Implement user registration
   * Implement registering new reviews
   * Explore React libraries to speed up UI development
