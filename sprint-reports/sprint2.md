# Sprint x Report (9/10/21 - 10/7/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created requirements portion of the project description
 * Created initial react app to build our app on
 * Created UI mock up and had it approved by our client 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we laid out the ground work for how the rest of the project would be built. We also created basic framework for our project and have began to implementing the features. While none have been completed for this sprint we are in a good spot to make quick progress towards MVP in our next sprint.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
