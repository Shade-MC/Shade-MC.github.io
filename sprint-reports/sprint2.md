# Sprint 2 Report (9/10/21 - 10/7/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created requirements and solutions approach sections of project report
 * Created UI mock ups, presented to client, and received feedback and ideas for new features
 * Created initial react app, which will be used as the basis for our remaining UI features
 * Implemented React component for Login feature (however, not yet integrated with backend)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In addition to making progress on our project report, we finally began the development phase of our project. Namely, we installed all the dependencies required for the MERN stack, which include NodeJS, React, MongoDB, and Express, and initialized our React app. We then chose to implement the Login component for our sprint's basic UI feature. 

A significant takeway from this sprint was the importance of starting early on our assigned tasks. For this sprint's deliverables, we only began discussing work divisions a few days before the due date. Although (aside from the backend of the login feature) we succesfully completed each of our assigned tasks on time, this was only because they were fairly straightforward. For the more complex  development tasks in our upcoming sprints, this approach will definitely not fly - the implementation of a feature is rarely without its complications, meaning we need to give ourselves as much time as possible to overcome potential roadblocks. It will be the responsibility of the team lead in the remaining sprints to ensure everyone is notified of their assigned tasks well before the due date.

## Unfinished Work
Although we completed the user-facing portion of the Login feature, we still need to integrate it with our Express/MongoDB backend. That is, we still need to create the API for processing login requests and create the necessary infrastructure in our MongoDB database to store and query user account information. The reason this backend component was not implemented as planned was because it took longer than expected.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication between team members
  * Quickly completing assigned tasks
  * Splitting work between team members
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Improved communication with our client
   * Being more proactive in taking/assigning issues
   * Beginning tasks well before due date to make room for potential roadblocks (i.e., padding)
   * Updating our Github tasks/issues more frequently to ensure they're up to date (as opposed to only giving task updates in group chat)
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Fully implement login (i.e., with backend integration, not just frontend UI)
   * Implement user registration
   * Implement registering new reviews
   * Explore React libraries to speed up UI development
