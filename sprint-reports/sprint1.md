# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/21 - 9/9/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Wrote our personal bios, which included our education, skills, work experience, and outside interests
 * Compiled and formatted personal bios into a team inventory
 * Reached out to client and scheduled first client meeting
 * Met with client to gain better understanding of project requirements and motivation
 * Began writing project description document

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
To complete these preleminary tasks, we relied heavily on frequent and responsive communication. Namely, for each item we needed to accomplish, we notified each other in the team chat, discussed and voted on any issues that needed to be resolved, and then quickly sent back our assigned contribution. This effective style of communication and quick turn-around is something we'd like to carry forward throughout the remaining sprints.

Our overall approach to the sprint items emphasized speed over quality. For instance, when writing the personal bios, we understood that it was important for us to make a good first impression to the client, but we were also aware that it was more important that we send out the team inventory in a timely manner - this way, we could meet with the client and get started on the project planning as soon as possible. For this reason, we didn't waste any time adding superfluous detail or polishing the document formatting, which would've needlessly delayed the client introduction. This ability to prioritize certain measures over others is also something we'd like to continue in the future. 

One barrier we dealt with was the client not responding to our initial introduction. This was problematic because without his response, we couldn't schedule our initial client meeting until later, which ultimately delayed the writing of our project description document. We resolved this issue by sending out a follow-up email, which quickly received a response. This taught us an important lesson that our mentor emphasized during our coaching meeting - in order to succeed, we need to be proactive. That is, if something's wrong, we need to take action instead of hoping the issue will resolve itself. Part of this involves being better at monitoring project progress so we can identify and address these issues earlier.

## Unfinished Work
We have not yet completed the project description document, which was technically due today. This is because our client meeting was scheduled late, meaning we didn't have enough information to begin writing the document until this evening. We plan to have this done by tomorrow night. So far, we've made progress on the intro and the client/stakeholders sections but still need to start on the background/related work, and the project overview sections.
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were very responsive to messages in the team chat
  * We completed our assigned tasks quickly
  * We effectively prioritized the most important aspects of the sprint items
  * We were prepared for our first meeting with our client and we communicated well
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Monitoring project progress more frequently to identify and address issues earlier
   * Being more proactive in resolving blockers
   * Taking better advantage of our coaching meetings
   * Taking advantage of meetings with our client to collaborate on this project
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Review current sprint tasks daily to identify blockers
   * Coming prepared to coaching meeting with list of clarification/guidance questions 
   * Using our weekly meetings with our client wisely to collaborate on this project
