# Project name 

STEM Research Review Paper Portal

## Project summary

A web app that serves as a public registry for systematic review papers in the STEM fields. Using this online portal, STEM researchers can upload details of their own ongoing review papers, search for and learn about existing review projects, and connect with potential collaborators in their field. This platform seeks to help researchers stay informed about current review efforts, allowing them to better cooperate with their peers and gain a clearer understanding of what has and hasn't been covered by others.

### One-sentence description of the project

A comprehensive online portal for ongoing STEM systematic review papers that informs researchers and connects authors to potential contributors.

### Additional information about the project

By creating an exhaustive database of ongoing systematic reviews, we hope to build the definitive platform for STEM researchers looking to learn more about the state of reviews in their field.
